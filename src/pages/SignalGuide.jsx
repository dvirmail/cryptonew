        Understanding the Auto-Scanner Logs
      </CardTitle>
      <CardDescription>
        The scanner provides detailed logs for every decision it makes. Here‚Äôs how to interpret them.

        <h3 className="font-semibold text-lg mb-2">Anatomy of a Log Line</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Each signal evaluation in a strategy is logged. Let's break down an example:
        </p>
        <pre className="bg-gray-100 dark:bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg text-sm">
          <code>
            <span className="text-red-500 font-bold">‚ùå</span> stochastic: Expected "Overbought" ‚Üí Got "Neutral" (Strength: 52)
          </code>
        </pre>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mt-4 space-y-2">
          <li><strong className="text-red-500">‚ùå (Icon):</strong> A red X means the signal's actual state did <span className="font-bold">not match</span> what the strategy required. A green check <strong className="text-green-500">‚úÖ</strong> means it was a perfect match.</li>
          <li><strong>stochastic:</strong> The name of the indicator being evaluated.</li>
          <li><strong>Expected "Overbought":</strong> This is the condition the trading strategy was looking for.</li>
          <li><strong>Got "Neutral":</strong> This was the actual, live condition of the indicator at the moment of the scan.</li>
          <li><strong>(Strength: 52):</strong> A calculated score from 0-100 indicating the intensity or confidence of the detected signal ("Neutral" in this case). A higher strength means a more pronounced signal.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3 className="font-semibold text-lg mb-2">Why Do Some Indicators Have Negative Numbers?</h3>
        <p>
          Some advanced indicators operate on scales that include negative values. This is normal and part of their design.
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mt-4 space-y-2">
          <li><strong>Williams %R:</strong> Operates on a scale of -100 to 0. Values from -20 to 0 are considered "overbought," and values from -80 to -100 are "oversold."</li>
          <li><strong>CCI (Commodity Channel Index):</strong> Oscillates around zero. Readings above +100 imply overbought conditions, while readings below -100 imply oversold conditions.</li>
          <li><strong>Awesome Oscillator / MACD Histogram:</strong> When the value is positive, it indicates bullish momentum. When it's negative, it indicates bearish momentum. The value crossing from negative to positive is a key bullish signal.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3 className="font-semibold text-lg mb-2">Final Trade Decisions</h3>
        <p>After evaluating all signals, the scanner makes a final check:</p>
        <pre className="bg-gray-100 dark:bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg text-sm mb-2">
          <code>
            <span className="text-yellow-500 font-bold">üö´</span> TRADE BLOCKED: Combined strength (150) below threshold (225)
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          This means that even if some signals matched, the <span className="font-semibold">total combined strength</span> of all signals in the strategy was not high enough to meet the minimum requirement (in this case, 150 was less than the required 225), so the trade was safely blocked.
