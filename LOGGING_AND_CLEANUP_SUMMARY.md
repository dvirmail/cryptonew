# Logging and Cleanup Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### 1. ‚ö° Order History Check Runs FIRST (Before Retry Skip)

**Problem**: Order history check was running AFTER retry skip logic, causing positions that were already closed on Binance to be incorrectly skipped.

**Solution**: Moved order history check to run IMMEDIATELY after error detection, before any retry logic.

**Key Changes**:
- Order history check now runs at line 2915 (right after error detection)
- Check window extended from 30 minutes to **2 hours** to catch positions closed in recent cycles
- Increased limit from 20 to **50 orders** for more comprehensive search
- Detailed logging added for every step of the order history check

**Logs Added**:
```
[ORDER_HISTORY_CHECK] START: Error type, symbol, positionQty
[ORDER_HISTORY_CHECK] Fetching recent orders from Binance...
[ORDER_HISTORY_CHECK] Received X total orders
[ORDER_HISTORY_CHECK] Found X recent FILLED SELL orders
[ORDER_HISTORY_CHECK] Order #N: orderId, qty, time
[ORDER_HISTORY_CHECK] Order X: qty, diff, tolerance, matches ‚úÖ/‚ùå
[ORDER_HISTORY_CHECK] MATCH FOUND / NO MATCH FOUND
[ORDER_HISTORY_CHECK] COMPLETE: ran=true, result={...}
```

2. ‚úÖ **Database** - DELETE via API
3. ‚úÖ **LocalStorage** - Remove all position-related keys
4. ‚úÖ **Wallet State** - Clear positions array and count
